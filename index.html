                <p class="about__bees-paragraph">
                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
                    from San Francisco, California. The band
                    consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
                    vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a
                    keyboardist and a drummer. The band
                    achieved its first commercial success as an
                    unsigned act, drawing attention from their
                    future manager. Having extensive experience
                    working with both new and seasoned acts, the
                    manager was confident the band could
                    succeed even further with more support,
                    pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well
                    known record label.
                </p>
                <p class="about__bees-paragraph">
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining
                    international recognition and ranking in the
                    top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
                    immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                    and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
                    one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
                    acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                    themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
                    their candid and authentic performances on
                    stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording
                    their second studio album, looking to be
                    released in early 2024.
